## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
npm start
```
- Runs on http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is in use)
- Hot reload enabled
- Source map warnings are expected (from Excalidraw dependencies)

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
- Creates optimized production build in `build/` folder
- Ready for deployment to any static hosting service

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```
- Runs the test suite (basic setup included)

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Touch-friendly interface for tablets

## Performance Considerations
- ✅ Optimized React components with useCallback
- ✅ Minimal bundle size after dependency cleanup
- ✅ Efficient Excalidraw integration
- ✅ Error boundaries prevent app crashes

## Known Issues & Warnings
1. **Webpack Source Map Warnings**: Expected warnings from Excalidraw dependencies, don't affect functionality
2. **Deprecation Warnings**: From webpack dev server, will be resolved in future React Scripts updates

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Add WebSocket support for multi-user editing
2. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with cloud services for session persistence
3. **Advanced AI Features**: Enhance AI summary with actual AI service integration
4. **Export Options**: Add PDF, PNG, SVG export capabilities
5. **Templates**: Pre-built drawing templates and shapes library

## Deployment Ready
The application is now production-ready with:
- ✅ Clean, optimized code
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ No console logs in production
- ✅ Minimal dependencies
- ✅ Good performance characteristics
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility

## Support & Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates recommended
