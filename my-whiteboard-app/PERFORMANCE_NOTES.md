# Performance Optimization Recommendations

## Bundle Size Analysis
Current production build size: **706.93 kB** (gzipped)

This is larger than the recommended size for web applications. Here are optimization opportunities:

## 1. Code Splitting Opportunities
Consider implementing React.lazy() for:
- ExcalidrawWrapper component (largest dependency)
- ErrorBoundary (only needed when errors occur)

```javascript
// Example implementation:
const ExcalidrawWrapper = React.lazy(() => import('./ExcalidrawWrapper'));
const ErrorBoundary = React.lazy(() => import('./ErrorBoundary'));

// Usage with Suspense:
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading whiteboard...</div>}>
  <ExcalidrawWrapper onDataChange={handleWhiteboardDataChange} />
</Suspense>
```

## 2. Dependency Optimization
- Excalidraw library is the largest contributor to bundle size
- Consider using dynamic imports for less frequently used features
- Monitor Excalidraw version updates for size improvements

## 3. Build Optimizations
- Consider enabling source map analysis: `npm run build -- --analyze`
- Implement service worker for caching (PWA)
- Consider CDN hosting for static assets

## 4. Runtime Optimizations
- ✅ Added useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Implemented error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- ✅ Removed unused dependencies

## Future Considerations
- Implement virtual DOM optimizations for large drawings
- Consider WebAssembly for performance-critical drawing operations
- Add progressive loading for complex whiteboard features
